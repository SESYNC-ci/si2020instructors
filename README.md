# si2020instructors
Meet your 2020 Summer Institute instructors!

Hi, I'm Rachael Blake.  I lead the data science team at SESYNC, and I'm a quantitative marine ecologist.  My research focuses on biodiversity, community structure, and the impacts of multiple stressors in marine ecosystems.  I also study how changes in these ecosystems influence social and ecological well-being.  I use data synthesis as well as field and lab experiments to test assumptions and hypotheses.  I'm interested in furthering open science and use data science tools to improve workflows and reproducibility.  

My goals for this week:
- provide a positive learning space
- learn about your interesting research
- help you overcome specific or conceptual project hurdles
- have fun!
