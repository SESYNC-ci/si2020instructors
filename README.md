[Quentin](http://quentinread.com) is a member of the SESYNC data science team. He also does research on the environmental impacts of food waste, assessing different solutions for food waste reduction. He got his start as an ecologist, studying the effects of climate change on plant communities, and large-scale biodiversity patterns in mammals, birds, and trees. You can see Q's life trajectory on the map below --- which also happens to be his eBird map, showing the different US states where he's seen birds!
